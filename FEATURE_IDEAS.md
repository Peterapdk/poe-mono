# 💡 Feature Ideas for the Autonomous Agent System

After analyzing the current `pi-mono` and `gateway` architecture, here are 5 high-impact feature ideas:

## 1. 🌐 Distributed Skills Registry
Currently, nodes are generic. A skills registry would allow nodes to "announce" their specific capabilities (e.g., "I have `ffmpeg` and 100GB disk space" or "I have `gh` and `npm`"). The Gateway can then intelligently route tasks to the specific Node best equipped to handle them.

## 2. 🎨 Visual Interaction Canvas
Implement a "Canvas" service that renders HTML, React, and Mermaid diagrams generated by the agent in real-time. This provides a rich, interactive UI for users to view agent artifacts, similar to "Claude Artifacts" but fully self-hosted.

## 3. 🧠 Semantic Long-Term Memory (RAG)
Go beyond `MEMORY.md` by integrating vector search (e.g., using Supabase `pgvector`). This allows the agent to semantically search through months of conversation history to find relevant context, decisions, and code snippets that are outside its immediate token window.

## 4. 👁️ Multi-Modal Environment Observation
Enable Nodes to capture screenshots or recordings of their execution environment. This "visual feedback loop" allows the agent to interact with GUI applications, debug visual layout issues, and verify that its actions had the intended effect on the system's state.

## 5. 🤝 Collaborative Multi-Agent Consensus
When complex tasks are assigned, the Gateway can spin up multiple "specialist" agents (e.g., a "Coder" and a "Reviewer"). The agents can iterate on a task together, with the Reviewer agent providing feedback and the Coder agent refining the implementation before the final output is presented to the user.
